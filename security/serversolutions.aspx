                                        Active Servers is a leading provider of backup solutions that offer peace of mind and protection for your valuable data. With the increasing risk of cyber threats and natural disasters, it is more important than ever to have a reliable backup system in place. 
Data backup is a requirement that is specific to each business; We are here to help you to assist on what an enterprise backup and recovery solution would look like for your business and answer any questions you may have. Active Servers provides a range of backup solutions and backup options that suit different needs and budgets including daily, weekly and monthly backups.
                                            <br />
                                        <br />
In order to reduce the amount of data lost between backups, copies of backups are made consistently and regularly for the best results. When recovering from a backup, there is a greater risk of data loss the more time passes between backup copies. The flexibility to restore to a point in time unaffected by data corruption or malicious attacks is provided by keeping multiple copies of the data.
Active Servers configure backup solutions to fit a variety of needs, ranging from simple file backups to complete system backups.

                                    <p>In Server Management, if VPS hosting is purchased from Active Servers, we not only take care of the its availability, but we also manage the security, core upgrades, maintenance, installing any PHP versions, extensions, etc. 
</p> <br> <p>
In unmanaged VPS hosting, the client needs to perform all the server responsibilities such as updates, installing any PHP versions or extensions and other tasks so that the client must have the technical expertise or a server administrator to manage server. Managing the servers yourself requires time and technical expertise. We do not recommend unmanaged/self-managed VPS hosting to clients who do not have technical expertise; In such a case, managed or semi-managed VPS is the best solution. We provide semi-managed support to all our VPS plans at no extra cost or server management can be add as addon so client need not worry about anything server related. </p>

                                     It is basic that you keep a backup for your important data. We suggest you take an automatic backup to another drive, so even in the case of a disk failure, we can restore your server data. However, if you can't afford the downtime and your data is very important, you can buy another server with similar configuration and similar control panel (usually most servers use control panel like plesk) and take automatic daily backups on it so you can change DNS and go is live again within minutes.

                                    <p>We process the server migration into 4 steps. </p><br>
<p><b>Step 1:</b>

Once the access is given to both the servers (source server and destination server), we migrate all the data from the source server to the destination server without making the new server live immediately. 
</p><p><br>
<b>Step 2: </b>

After all the data is migrated, we'll ask you to test your website's data on the new server, plus we'll point 1 website DNS to the new server to check that things are OK. 
</p><p><br>
<b>Step 3: </b>

Now, when you confirm that all data is OK, we will ask you the time and date to go live with the new server, preferably in the mid-night or on weekends when traffic and load on the server are low. 
</p><p><br>
<b>Step 4: </b>

At that point, we resync files and databases that were modified or recently added after the migration, so no data will lose since the initial migration. Also, we can change the DNS TTL (time to live) for all your domains to 10 minutes for at least 24 hours before going live with your new server. Therefore, it will not be caching your domain DNS for more than 10 minutes and IP changes will be reflected very fast after migration.

                                     We recommend you to configure CDN and Nginx web server to improve your website loading time but for any optimization from the coding side, web developer has to take care of it. 
 </p> <br><p>
Nginx is the leading web server in serving static content and it's open-source web server. Nginx is 2.5 times faster than Apache. Nginx is a HTTP and reverse proxy server. Netflix, Wordpress.com, FastMail.FM, all are running on Nginx.</p>
